13.22","description":"## CHONCC\u2019S TREASURE\\n---\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Fortune\u2019s Favor is back, as the more seasonally appropriate Choncc\u2019s Treasure! The mode (and Choncc) has an all new look too!\\n\\n---\\n### SYSTEM CHANGES\\n\\n- With Carousel gone, the starting unit you receive is now a random 4 or 5-cost. Units will be of the same cost for all players.\\n- After the carousel round, Choncc will come by to give you special loot orbs. More and more rewards will be given out the later into the game it gets.\\n- At 50 Tactician Health, the player will receive a large golden orb with some special items to help them catch back up.\\n- Two new items were added! Choncc\'s Prowler\'s Claw and Choncc\'s Rocket-Propelled Fist. Expect to see these in special loot drops.\\n- Loot drops and patterns have been updated.\\n- Both Region Portals and Remastered Portals are available options.\\n\\n## NEW PLAYER ONBOARDING\\n---\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ The following changes go live with patch 13.23 (Remix Rumble\u2019s launch) and only impact \\"new players\\", who have played 3 or fewer non-Tutorial games of TFT on that account. \\n- New players will only be able to queue for Normals, all other queues will be locked\\n- During a player\u2019s first 3 games, new players will see bots in their games. These bots will adapt to their skill, providing a more gradual onramp to TFT.\\n- Players will only see these bots in their first 3 games. Players WILL NOT encounter them in any queue after their first 3 games.\\n- Established players who have already played more than 3 games of TFT won\u2019t see any changes unless they queue with a new player, and they won\u2019t be able to join any other queue besides Normals while in a Lobby with a new player. Prism\u2019s note to these established players queuing with newcomers: \u201cPlease be kind to our bots - they\u2019re nowhere close to Challengers, but still appreciate a \u201c\u2018gg wp.\u2019\u201d\\n\\n## SYSTEM CHANGES\\n---\\n\\n### REGION PORTALS\\n- Scuttle Puddle and Beats By Scuttle have been re-enabled. Rejoice!\\n- Scuttle Dragon (XL Scuttle Crab) now drops more gold and an additional item!\\n\\n---\\n### OVERTIME BUFF\\n__Developer Notes:__ When overtime hits, the round ends in an instant, as champions gain an URF-load of power and start one-shotting each other. This can also result in a situation where two AP casters are opposing each other and the one who casts their ability first wins despite the opposing caster being a higher star, or having items. Now the Overtime buff will ramp over time, resulting in combats that end quickly, but not suddenly. \\n- URF Overtime buff no longer grants bonus AP or AD.\\n- Overtime now grants a stacking buff every second that gives 10% more damage, 10% more attack speed, 10% less healing and shielding received (capped at 70%), 10% less crowd control duration (capped at 70%).\\n- Also grants a flat movement speed bonus (unchanged)\\n\\n## LARGE CHANGES\\n---\\n\\n### TRAITS\\n__Developer Notes:__ With our last patch of the set, some changes aren\u2019t entirely about balance. Our Bruiser 3 change comes from Mort\u2019s tendency to field 3 Bruisers, a suboptimal play given his status as the S.G.O.A.T. (second greatest of all time). Seeing the misplay, chat gets chatting, talkers get talking, and yappers get yapping. To silence the chats and yaps, Mort has gone in and added a Bruiser 3 trait breakpoint with numerical values that honestly do not move the needle in the way the trait should be played.\\n\\nWhile some Ixtal elements have found successful comps, others have fallen by the wayside like a Stone in the Wind.\\n\\nWhile we\u2019ve seen success with Zaun 2 in a number of cases, Zaun 4/6 have been underwhelming for most of Horizonbound, so we\u2019re making all the mods better to encourage playing the trait for the last patch. \\n- Bilgewater Damage Amp: 33/60/70/135% \u21d2 40/60/70/135%\\n- Bruiser Structure: 2/4/6 \u21d2 2/3/4/6\\n- Bruiser HP: 10/40/80% \u21d2 10/12/45/80%\\n- Freljord max Health True Damage: 8/15% \u21d2 10/18%\\n- Gunner AD per Stack: 6/12/25% \u21d2 7/13/25%\\n- Ixtal Electric Stun Duration: 2 \u21d2 3 seconds\\n- Ixtal Stone Duration: 8 \u21d2 10 seconds\\n- Ixtal Stone Heal: 750 \u21d2 900\\n- Ixtal Wind Duration: 4/5 \u21d2 5/10 seconds\\n- Ixtal Wind AS: 40/100% \u21d2 50/100%\\n- Zaun Adaptive Implant AD/AP & Omnivamp: 35% \u21d2 40%\\n- Zaun Adaptive Implant Overcharge amount: 50% \u21d2 60%\\n- Zaun Hextech Exoskeleton Base Heal: 15% \u21d2 20%\\n- Zaun Hextech Exoskeleton Overcharge Heal: 25% \u21d2 30%\\n- Zaun Robotic Arm Overcharge: 25% \u21d2 30%\\n- Zaun Shimmer Injector Base AS & Heal: 35% \u21d2 44%\\n- Zaun Virulent Bioware Base Damage: 18% \u21d2 20%\\n- Zaun Virulent Bioware Overcharge Max HP: 4% \u21d2 6%\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 1\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Orianna is getting a spell adjustment that amps up her single target damage and lowers the power of her shield.

This also impacts Beats by Scuttle.\\n\\n---\\n### TRAITS\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ The jump from Multicaster 3 to 4 is too large compared to other traits. Multicasters have the issue of bursting boards too quickly AND they\'re able to do so even faster with the bonus on-attack Mana at MC 4. By nerfing the trait slightly at 3, and more significantly at 4, we\u2019re able to slow down the pace of combat, while also making the power jump a bit less sharp. MC 3 will now be your core damage bump, while MC 4 is for allowing your other Multicasters to cast more. \\n- Challenger Attack Speed: 30/60/95/140 \u21d2 30/65/105/150\\n- Multicaster Multicaster Bonus Cast Reduced Effectiveness: 55/30/25% \u21d2 55/35/35%\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 2\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Twisted Fate is the only unit we\u2019re shipping a nerf to, and it\u2019s pretty big. Even after nerfs in our 13.20 mid-patch update, TF continues to have the deck stacked in his favor. It\u2019s time to reshuffle the cards. TF will also be impacted by our nerfs to Multicaster (above section), and Blue Buff (see items). Additionally, TF\u2019s best friends are also getting lighter nerfs.\\n\\nThe amount of nerfs and severity of the Twisted Fate-specific nerf below may seem extreme, but so is Twisted Fate\u2019s performance, who at two-stars on Stage 3 outplaces most comps with a two-star 4-cost. \\n- Twisted Fate Stacked Deck AoE Delayed Damage: 185/275/435% AP \u21d2 155/235/380% AP\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 3\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Our AD ratio buff for Darius failed to cement him as a viable reroll carry. We\u2019re adjusting his damage dropoff on resets to bring dunking back in style like it\u2019s 1996 (the release of the original Space Jam film).\\n\\nMiss Fortune is another reroll carry that has just missed the spot (despite marking it). We planned on buffing her already, but with our nerf to her core item (Blue Buff), we\u2019re giving her an even buffer buff.\\n\\nEven after our Nautilus buff in 13.20 to his bonus Armor and MR, players still aren\u2019t giving him their Chain Vests and Negatron Cloaks. Instead of letting him sink to the bottom of the Guardian\u2019s Sea, we\u2019re increasing both his base defensive stats and his passive amplification. So go ahead and give him that tank item\u2014he really wants it, and I\u2019m getting a bit worried about him.\\n\\nSona and Vel\u2019Koz are receiving smaller nerfs to account for the power they received with our Multicaster rework last patch.

Unburdened is the antithesis to that statement, and we\u2019ve seen both player data and vocal feedback validating that. Instead of buffing or reworking an Augment that players just aren\'t excited about, we\u2019re pulling it entirely and saving you the Augment reroll.\\n\\nWhile we discussed nerfing the TF Legend Augment package (notably Pandora\'s) we saw that the success of the Legend was tied to the success of other balance outliers that we\'ve nerfed in various ways, so we leaving the Augment in tact as we await the impact of our changes here. \\n- Binary Airdrop no longer appears on 2-1\\n- Built Different II Health 225-475 \u21d2 250-500\\n- Built Different II no longer appears on 3-2\\n- Built Different III Health 300-550 \u21d2 300-600\\n- Built Different III no longer appears on 3-2\\n- Cybernetic Leech III Health 225 \u21d2 250\\n- Endless Hordes + Gold 12 \u21d2 14\\n- Golden Ticket chance for a free refresh 50% \u21d2 45%\\n- Parting Gifts max Health shield 40% \u21d2 50%\\n- Riftwalk AP 35 \u21d2 38\\n- Stationary Support I: Now delays all rewards (Training Dummy and Support Item) until after 8 player combats\\n- Stellacorn\u2019s Blessing (Targon) Attack speed 35% \u21d2 40%\\n- Unburdened I and Unburdened II have been disabled\\n- Wandering Trainer Gold 4 \u21d2 6\\n\\n---\\n### ITEMS\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ We\u2019re taking a light pass on Mana items since they disproportionately lead to faster combat states. Blue Buff and Protector\u2019s Vow are meant to stand out and provide an early cast, but we\'re making that early cast later by lowering the starting Mana to 30 (Blue Buff is 30 since you get 10 reduction). As a final note, Blue Buff and Protector\'s Vow have been too strong for a while now, which means champions who use them well benefit far more than champions who have strong synergies with other items.

But we missed the mark, overshooting the power of the reworked Multicaster comp and failing to nerf Nilah\u2019s power ceiling which became higher with the Nilah / Sejuani comp\u2019s discovery, and nerfs to other meta comps. And here we are a bit over 24 hours later with a few solves to apply. \\n\\n---\\n### TRAITS\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Multicaster was the big winner of 13.20. The trait is providing too much power at 4, with the effectiveness of the repeat cast, but we\u2019re also looking at their core carry that has benefited from the increased power of the trait the most (Twisted Fate). \\n\\n- Multicaster 4 additional cast reduced effectiveness: 20% \u21d2 25%\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Nilah\u2019s rise through the ranks after the popular Nilah / Sejuani comp\u2019s discovery over the weekend. Our nerfs are focusing on lowering the power of Nilah with extra range (read Rapid Firecannon), who benefits the most from the cleave damage as it hits even more enemies. Ranged Nilah can also take advantage of the ramping attack speed from safety, so reducing that will also disproportionately impact the ranged playstyle. In addition to the change we have below, we\u2019re also nerfing her through an Augment that takes her from being strong, to being straight up wrong (for balance).\\n\\nWe\u2019re also taking this time to sneak in a small buff to Azir, that\u2019ll feel larger as you give him more Attack Speed items.\\n\\nOur multicaster rework had the intentions of making Sona and Taliyah more viable, but in doing so it also buffed the already-successful Twisted Fate. \\n\\n- Azir Attack Speed: 0.75 \u21d2 0.8\\n- Fiora Armor and Magic Resist: 40 \u21d2 45\\n- Kai\u2019Sa starting Mana buff: 40/120 \u21d2 60/120\\n- Nilah Formless Blade Passive Cleave Damage ratio: 65/65/100% AD \u21d2 55/55/100% AD\\n- Nilah Stacking AS: 20% \u21d2 18%\\n- Twisted Fate Stacked Deck Explosion (delayed) Damage: 210/315/490% AP \u21d2 185/275/435% AP\\n\\n---\\n### AUGMENTS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Scoped Weapons has gone from being one of the least picked Augments in the first half of Runeterra Reforged, to being one of the biggest top four enablers of Horizonbound. The way it breaks weaknesses in champions like Mordekaiser and Nilah, creates a situation where we either have to balance them around access to the Augment, or disable the Augment entirely. We\u2019re not a fan of completely disabling an Augment, but when the alternative is gating the success of Mordekaiser and Nilah behind access to this Augment, the decision is obvious.\\n\\nThrough continued optimization, Demonflare has become more powerful than the parameters of a Gold Augment. We\u2019re taking the ramping damage amp down a notch, but it should continue to be strong when combined with a sustain item. \\n\\n- Demonflare Damage Amp: 3% \u21d2 2.5%\\n- Petricite Shackles Bonus Damage (against Noxians): 22% \u21d2 18%\\n- Scoped Weapons has been disabled\\n\\n---\\n### ITEMS\\n- Absolution (Radiant Redemption) Health: 300 \u21d2 200\\n- Absolution (Radiant Redemption) Damage Reduction: 15% \u21d2 10%"}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z1yb6g2ffrt0"}},"id":"5CxfPD8U3CGl92J8AKs1Lm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2023-10-11T08:28:46.069Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-11T08:28:46.069Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"patchTftactics"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Patch 13.20","description":"## FOR FUN PATCH CHANGES\\n---\\n\\n### NORMALS (PORTALS - REMASTERED)\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ New combination portals can now appear in the voting selection during Normal games only.

As a reminder, you can adjust your Team Planner loadout on the fly! \\n\\n- Plan your team comp in Team Planner, then turn on in-game reminders to see your selected champions marked in the Shop.\\n\\n## LARGE CHANGES\\n---\\n\\n### TRAITS\\n__Developer Notes:__ We\u2019re flattening out the power curve for Bilgewater to make it appropriately strong as you continue to reach high breakpoints. The Bilgewater 9 buff is focused on the flat cannonball damage, as you\u2019re typically fielding a crew that\u2019s not all capable of utilizing the stored damage dealt percentage.\\n\\nMulticaster comps have been dependent on hitting 3-star of everything due to the way their trait amplifies the base damage of their spell. Once they\u2019re 3-star, and you have all 4 of them, they\u2019ll be able to one-shot boards, but they often struggle to make it there. To solve these problems we\u2019re doing a few individual champion changes, alongside reworking the trait to have smoother power breakpoints (2/3/4), and a separate lever to give power to non-itemized Multicasters at Multicaster (4) rather than giving them more damage burst.\\n\\nWe expect Mutlicaster (4) reroll to be the best version of the comp and alongside buffs to Twisted Fate and Sona, 2/3 Multicaster can be viable splashes in other comps like Demacia, Bilgewater, and Sorcs. Be sure to try out the reroll verticals and splashes alike and let us know what you think!\\n\\nIonia\u2019s Emblem is providing far too much power for it also to contribute to a trait with powerful breakpoints so we\u2019re taking some of its Attack Speed away.\\n\\nShurima is struggling at the moment, and their main carry, Azir, is really weak, both in Shurima verticals and Strategist-heavy boards. We\u2019ve got buffs for both of these traits, with our Strategist buffs in the small section focused on empowering the deeper 4 and 5 Strategist.\\n\\nWith Zaun, we\u2019re buffing the Overcharged versions of each chem-mod to ensure all variations of Zaun 4 and 6 are worth chasing! \\n\\n- Bilgewater 3 (unchanged but here for reference): 100 + 33% damage dealt\\n- Bilgewater 5 Damage: 150 + 55% damage dealt \u21d2 170 + 60% damage dealt\\n- Bilgewater 7 (unchanged but here for reference): 325 + 70% damage dealt\\n- Bilgewater 9 flat Damage: 800 \u21d2 999\\n- REWORKED Multicaster 2/4 \u21d2 2/3/4\\n- Multicaster 2: Cast 1 additional time at 55% reduced effectiveness.\\n- Multicaster 3: Cast 1 additional time at 30% reduced effectiveness.\\n- Multicaster 4: Cast 1 additional time at 20% reduced effectiveness.

This will allow him to fit better under the power ceiling of a 1-cost that he\u2019s so often seen bursting through at 3-stars, but this will also help out the lowly 1-star Cho that you play just to hit the Void or Bruiser trait breakpoint.This will also make the difference between hitting that 2-star Cho early versus later a bit smaller.\\n\\nOrianna is our weakest 1-cost whose single target damage and shielding fail to make her a unit worth fielding outside of being a trait-bot. But unlike Orianna, who gave her heart to her father, we have the heart to give her some buffs that will allow her to cast more frequently via a lower max Mana, and a higher Attack Speed. Maybe one day, she too will get to be an item holder. \\n\\n- Cho\u2019Gath Feast Health On Kill: 30/35/40 \u21d2 35\\n- Graves Smoke Grenade damage: 220/220/230% AD \u21d2 200/200/205% AD\\n- Orianna Attack Speed 0.7 \u21d2 0.75\\n- Orianna Attack Damage 40 \u21d2 35\\n- Orianna max Mana buff: 30/80 \u21d2 20/70\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 2\\n__Developer Notes:__ Taliyah is currently underperforming even in her Double Trouble dream comp. With this buff, we\u2019re not only giving her some compensation damage after our Multicaster rework, but also attempting to make her more playable in both Shurima and Mutlicaster comps.\\n\\nSett\u2019s our best 2-cost right now, finding success at the core of our two most dominant comps (Ionia Vanquisher and Ashe Reroll). His utility and tankiness make him a snowball unit to slam items on early, and a consistent frontliner late. \\n\\n- Taliyah Seismic Shove damage: 180/270/410% AP \u21d2 200/300/450% AP\\n- Taliyah Seismic Shove passive Boulder damage: 110/160/240% AP \u21d2 120/180/270% AP\\n- Sett max Mana nerf: 40/90 \u21d2 60/110\\n- Sett Ionia Bonus Health: 200 \u21d2 180\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 3\\n__Developer Notes:__ Dare-bear (that\u2019s my pet name for Darius btw) has failed to execute as a reroll carry in Horizonbound. With a better AD ratio, he\u2019s not only going to be much stronger with AD items, but also with the Noxus traits.\\n\\nNautilus just really wants that Chain Vest and Negatron Cloak that you\u2019ve been giving Cho\u2019Gath this whole time. He\u2019ll do wonders with them, he promises!\\n\\nRek\u2019Sai\u2019s weakness is punching through beefy frontliners. While our rework that added the marked system helped her here, it required hitting 3-stars for the Void Burrower to do just that\u2014burrow into the enemy backline. We\u2019re now allowing her marks to persist until the end of combat instead of being consumed on the next bite to help her repeat casts cut through those high Armor Bastions and Thornmail enthusiasts. To account for this added power, and because her 3-star version was already performing well post-rework, we\u2019re lowering her damage ratio on the initial bite especially at 3-stars.\\n\\nBig things are happening with Multicaster this patch. One of them is the Sona rework, which will sharpen her role as a utility carry who can continually amp your team\'s Attack Speed! Try positioning her to hit your other Multicasters at Multicaster 4, Etwahl surely be successful.\\n\\nEditor\u2019s note: Etwahl is the name of Sona\u2019s instrument, but even knowing that will not save the pun above. \\n\\n- Darius Noxian Guillotine AD ratio: 300% AD \u21d2 350% AD\\n- Nautilus max Mana buff: 80/160 \u21d2 60/140\\n- Nautilus bonus Resistance Amplification: 30% \u21d2 35%\\n- NEW Rek\u2019Sai\u2019s bite marker will now persist until the end of combat instead of being consumed.\\n- Rek\u2019Sai Furious Bite AD ratio: 290/290/300% \u21d2 250/250/255%\\n- Rek\u2019Sai Marked Bite true damage AD ratio: 135/145/150% \u21d2 190/195/200%\\n- REWORK: Sona\u2019s Ability now deals 33% less damage to each unit hit\\n- Sona Crescendo Attack Speed: 35/40/45% for 5 seconds \u21d2 20/25/35% for the rest of combat\\n- Sona Crescendo will always hit allies on her left and right. You now do not have to awkwardly position your carries in front of her\\n- Sona Crescendo Damage: 105/155/255 \u21d2 180/270/440\\n- Sona starting Mana buff: 40/90 \u21d2 35/90\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 4\\n__Developer Notes:__ Aphelios is getting a base AD buff that may not seem worth dancing in the moonlight over, but will certainly put pep in your step for those running Gunner verticals (which greatly amplifies base AD).\\n\\nEven when in a balanced state, Fiora\u2019s untargetability created frustrating scenarios where you\u2019re forced to helplessly watch your units save their spells for her untargetability window. So we\u2019re cutting out the untargetable window, while giving her a large compensation buff to the rest of her kit since she\u2019ll be significantly more vulnerable! \\n\\n- Aphelios AD: 60 \u21d2 65\\n- REWORK: Fiora is no longer untargetable during Blade Waltz and now takes 30% less damage while Waltzing instead\\n- Fiora max Mana buff: 70/160 \u21d2 70/140\\n- Fiora Blade Waltz AD ratio: 140/140/240% \u21d2 160/160/240%\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 5\\n__Developer Notes:__ Darkin has always been a great trait, but Aatrox has hardly been able to carry the reputation of his passive trait, let alone his team. We\u2019re shifting some of the power from the Darkin buff into Aatrox to create a world where Aatrox can be your carry, and not just your world ender.\\n\\nGangplank\'s best cases are already powerful but he\'s too unreliable as a carry. We\'re reducing the situations where he crashes his ship ineffectively to make his performance and helmsmanship more consistent.\\n\\nLast patch we introduced a new carry-focused Upgrade for Heimmerdinger called the Refractor Beam. It opened up with more of a fizzle than a beam, with its power only really coming online after three dedicated Upgrades. We\u2019re giving the Upgrade a smoother power curve with an even more powerful triple Upgrade fantasy, so be sure to try it out! \\n\\n- Aatrox Darkin Bonus Health: 350 \u21d2 250\\n- Aatrox Armor & MR: 60 \u21d2 70\\n- Aatrox World Ender AD ratio: 275/275/2500% \u21d2 290/300/2500%\\n- Gangplank The Dreadway: If Gangplank\u2019s ship hasn\u2019t yet reached Gangplank, it\u2019ll pass through enemies dealing damage. After reaching Gangplank, or if Gangplank is dead, it\u2019ll crash on the next enemy hit\\n- Gangplank The Dreadway: The boat will now always crash if it hasn\u2019t hit an enemy after 2.25 seconds.\\n- Heimerdinger Refractor Beam Number of Beams 3/3/5 \u21d2 3\\n- Heimerdinger Refractor Beam Damage Amplification 10/30/30% \u21d2 10/40/80%\\n\\n---\\n### AUGMENTS\\n__Developer Notes:__ As trait linked Augments we\u2019re shipping some significant buffs to Adrenaline Rush (Juggernaut), Defensive Dash (Challenger), and Total Domination (Noxus) which have failed to succeed even when running their verticals.\\n\\nThe Multicaster rework means Multicasters cast fewer times. Increasing the AP per cast on their trait linked Augment, Perfect Repetition, will allow them to reach the same power ceiling as before.\\n\\nShurima\u2019s Legacy had an issue where the turret would not stop shooting random people after the player died. Now that\u2019s what I call leaving your legacy on the Convergence, but while staying true to its name, we can\u2019t have Turrets going rogue from beyond the grave. \\n\\n- Adrenaline Rush (Juggernaut): Grants a Warwick and a Sett \u21d2 Grants a Darius and a Sett\\n- Adrenaline Rush (Juggernaut) health Threshold for bonus damage: 50% \u21d2 60%\\n- Binary Airdropno longer grants an item component.\\n- Built Different II Health: 200 - 425 \u21d2 225 - 475\\n- Built Different III Attack speed: 45 - 65 \u21d2 50-70\\n- Caretaker\u2019s Ally now grants one copy of the 2-cost immediately.\\n- Defensive Dash (Challenger) Shield: 75 - 225 \u21d2 100 - 250\\n- Gifts From The Fallen AD and AP per stack 4 \u21d2 3\\n- Lucky Gloves: Gloves 3 \u21d2 2\\n- NEW: Lucky Gloves + added for 3-2 and 4-2, gives 3 gloves.\\n- Money Money!

Instead of taking power from its core counter-shield identity, we\u2019re reducing the Attack Speed it offers, which has been letting users cast far sooner than even Tear-based items like Hand of Justice. \\n\\n- Adaptive Helm Frontline Bonus: 35 Armor and MR \u21d2 35 Armor and MR. Gain 1 Mana when struck by an attack.\\n- Guardbreaker Attack Speed: 25% \u21d2 20%\\n\\n## SMALL CHANGES\\n---\\n\\n### REGION PORTALS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Over in Ixaocan, the capital city of Ixtal, Radiant Items come relatively late in the game, often after you\u2019ve committed to a direction. By pairing them with a Reforger, you\u2019ll get one more chance to re-roll them into something more fitting, OR you can use the reforger to pop the items off of your current carry if they have high synergy with the Radiant Item you just got. \\n\\n- Ixaocan Radiant Item drops now always come with a reforger.\\n\\n---\\n### TRAITS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Losing Lissandra in the mid-set really hurt Invoker as a vertical, so we\u2019re adding a bit more late game power to keep Invokers and their friends blasting and casting. \\n\\n- Invoker 6: 15 Mana to all \u21d2 20 Mana to all\\n- Strategist Shield: 250/400/575/850 \u21d2 250/400/600/900\\n- Strategis AP Bonus: 15/25/35/55 \u21d2 15/25/40/60\\n- Void, Rift Herald charge speed has been increased.\\n- Void, Rift Herald will now try to find a new target if her original target dies during her windup.\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 1\\n__Developer Notes:__ It\'s pretty common for fights to wind down and enemies to walk forward, causing Malzahar to miss his cast. This change makes sure that when he casts, he\'ll basically always hit those targets.
